import requests

url = "https://your_subdomain.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets.json"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"}
params = {"sort_by": "updated_at", "sort_order": "desc", "per_page": 100}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)

if response.status_code == 200:
    tickets = response.json()["tickets"]
    for ticket in tickets:
        print(ticket["subject"])
else:
    print(f"Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")





In this example, replace your_subdomain with your actual Zendesk subdomain,
and replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key. The params dictionary
specifies the query parameters to use in the API request, including the sort
order and number of tickets to retrieve. The API response is checked for a
successful status code, and the ticket subjects are printed to the console.
